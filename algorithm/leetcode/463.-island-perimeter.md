# 463. Island Perimeter

{% hint style="info" %}
You are given `row x col` `grid` representing a map where `grid[i][j] = 1` represents land and `grid[i][j] = 0` represents water.

Grid cells are connected **horizontally/vertically** (not diagonally). The `grid` is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.
{% endhint %}

#### Solution

bfs 로 탐색하여 코드를 작성한다. 이어져 있는 경우엔 상하좌우를 확인하여 각 사각형의 총 선분 수 (4) 중에 연결 된 곳을 제외한다.

이어진 island가 없을 때 까지 queue를 통해 탐색한다.
